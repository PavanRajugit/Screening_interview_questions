### 📌 Question 1: Tell me about yourself

**Model Answer:**

"I'm a recent graduate with a background in computer science, and I've completed several internships focused on front-end development. I enjoy solving real-world problems using code and have contributed to open-source projects in my free time. Right now, I'm looking to join a company where I can grow my skills, collaborate on meaningful work, and contribute to impactful products."

**Tips:**
- Start with **recent experience** and end with **what you’re looking for**  
- Keep it under **90 seconds**  
- Avoid personal history unless it’s relevant to the role

---

### 📌 Question 2: Why do you want to work here?

**Model Answer:**

"I've been following your company’s product launches and blog for a while, and I admire how you put user experience and ethical innovation at the center of your strategy. Your recent work on [mention feature/project] really aligns with my passion for building inclusive tech. I also value the emphasis you place on employee learning and growth, which is important to me at this stage of my career."

**Tips:**
- Mention a **specific product, value, or initiative**  
- Align their mission with your interests  
- Show you've done **basic research**

### 📌 Question 3: What are your strengths and weaknesses?

**Model Answer:**

"One of my strengths is communication—especially when working across teams. I make sure everyone’s on the same page, which reduces misunderstandings.  
As for a weakness, I used to overcommit to multiple tasks. But I’ve learned to better estimate effort and set clearer priorities using tools like Notion or Trello."

**Tips:**
- Keep weaknesses **real** but show **improvement**  
- Avoid cliché answers like “I’m a perfectionist”  
- Strengths should match the role’s needs

### 📌 Question 4: How do you handle feedback?

**Model Answer:**

"I see feedback as a learning tool. At my last internship, I received constructive feedback on how I was structuring my code. I took it as an opportunity to study best practices, refactored the module, and even documented my learnings for the team wiki."

**Tips:**
- Show a **real situation** and how you **applied the feedback**  
- Stay positive—feedback is a **growth tool**, not criticism  
- Show you're **proactive** in seeking it

---

### 📌 Question 5: Are you open to remote work or relocation?

**Model Answer:**

"I'm very open to remote work and have experience collaborating across time zones during my final project. That said, if the opportunity requires relocation and it's the right fit, I’m prepared to make that move."

**Tips:**
- Be honest about preferences  
- Highlight any **remote work skills**: communication tools, async work, etc.  
- If you can’t relocate, state that respectfully
